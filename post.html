                    <p>I’ve always loved airplanes—airports, boarding passes, the rhythm of takeoff and landing. So
                        spending a month flying through New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan
                        felt like the most natural way to see the world for me. One flight blurred into the next, and
                        before I knew it, whole countries were turning into memories instead of pins on a map.</p>
                    <p>New Zealand was where everything first felt unreal. The glow worm caves were quiet and surreal,
                        floating through darkness beneath what looked like a living galaxy. But Hobbiton might have
                        surprised me even more. Walking through those green hills, round doors, and tiny details felt
                        less like a movie set and more like stepping into someone else’s peaceful little world. New
                        Zealand had a calm to it that settled into me right away.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Hobbinton.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <p>Australia pulled the energy back up. The Sydney Opera House didn’t disappoint—it was bold and
                        striking, sitting right against the water like it belonged there. What stuck with me most,
                        though, was how the city moved: ferries crossing the harbor, people packed along the shoreline,
                        life happening outdoors constantly. It felt alive without feeling stressful.</p>
                    <p>Thailand shifted the entire mood of the trip. Bangkok was loud, hot, crowded, and never seemed to
                        slow down—and I loved it for that. The Royal Palace felt endless in gold and detail. One of my
                        favorite days was riding a boat along the west side of the city on the river, drifting past
                        everyday life along the water before arriving at the massive reclining Buddha. Seeing it in
                        person was overwhelming in scale and quiet in feeling.</p>
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Japan Rain.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <p>And then there was the food. Thailand completely reset my expectations. Every meal felt
                        unbeatable—street food especially. Eating off plastic stools late at night with traffic flying
                        past became normal, and somehow every dish still tasted incredible. Pad Thai, mango sticky rice,
                        grilled meat, fresh fruit—Thailand made food an experience, not just a necessity.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
                    <p>Chiang Mai slowed everything back down. Bathing elephants wasn’t flashy or rushed—it was calm and
                        personal. Standing in the water, brushing mud off animals that carried so much quiet strength, I
                        felt fully present. No crowds. No noise. Just one of those moments that doesn’t need explanation
                        to feel meaningful.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Thailand royal palace.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <p>Vietnam felt like controlled chaos wrapped in beauty. Tam Coc was calm and unreal, drifting
                        between towering green cliffs while someone rowed from behind. Lan Ha Bay felt open and endless,
                        like the trip paused for a breath. But Hanoi was the opposite—crossing the streets there felt
                        like stepping into moving traffic and trusting the flow to catch you. The energy was intense,
                        busy, loud, and completely unforgettable.</p>
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Taiwan.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Wisdom is gained through experiance, not text books. Find time to find the world and you will find yourself and how you fit in.</blockquote>
                    <p>Then came Taiwan—the place that surprised me the most and might be my favorite overall. The food
                        there was unreal: night markets, dumplings, noodles, and dishes I still think about. Hiking
                        Elephant Mountain gave me one of the best city views I’ve ever seen, and Taipei 101 made the
                        skyline feel massive from above. But what really stood out was the metro—easy, efficient,
                        spotless, and almost completely silent. It made the whole city feel effortless to move through.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">This is the way life is ment to be</h2>
                    <p>Japan was powerful in a very different way. Himeji Castle was sharp, white, and historic in the
                        most classic sense. Hiroshima, though, left the deepest mark. It was quiet, heavy, and
                        important. Visiting the gate over the water at Miyajima felt peaceful—like standing in a place
                        that quietly holds both sorrow and hope at once. That day stayed with me.</p>
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Japan Himjemi.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before –
                        that’s what living is all about.</span>
                    <p>Tokyo, surprisingly, didn’t fully click for me. It was impressive, fast, neon-lit, and
                        overwhelming in scale—but it never quite felt like mine. Riding the bullet train was still
                        unreal, watching the countryside blur past at impossible speed. Even when a place isn’t your
                        favorite, it still adds a layer to how you understand the world.</p>
                    <p>By the time I flew home, everything felt stitched together by time zones and boarding passes. I
                        didn’t just visit places—I felt their pace, their silence, their chaos, their flavor. A month
                        across six countries didn’t give me answers, but it gave me perspective, confidence, and a
                        deeper love for movement itself. And fittingly, some of my favorite moments of the whole trip
                        happened thousands of feet in the air.</p>
